To-Do List Laravel App
Welcome to the To-Do List Laravel App! This is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their own to-do lists.

Prerequisites
Before you can begin setting up the app, you will need to make sure that you have the following installed on your computer:

PHP 7.2 or higher
Composer
MySQL
Laravel 6.0 or higher
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-laravel.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd todo-list-laravel

Install the dependencies: composer install

Create a new MySQL database and update the .env file with your database credentials.

Run the migrations: php artisan migrate

Generate an app encryption key: php artisan key:generate

Start the local development server: php artisan serve

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to access the app.

Usage
Once the app is up and running, you can create new to-do lists and add tasks to them. You can also edit and delete existing tasks, and mark them as complete.
