<h2>To-Do List Laravel App</h2>
<a>Welcome to the To-Do List Laravel App!</a>
<p>This is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their own to-do lists.</p>

<a>Prerequisites</a>

<ol>
<li>PHP 7.2 or higher</li>
<li>Composer</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Laravel 6.0 or higher</li>
<li>Installation</li>
<li>Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-laravel.git</li>
    </ol>    

Navigate to the project directory: cd todo-list-laravel

Install the dependencies: composer install

Create a new MySQL database and update the .env file with your database credentials.

Run the migrations: php artisan migrate

Generate an app encryption key: php artisan key:generate
